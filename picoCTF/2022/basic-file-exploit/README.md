## Basic file exploit

Looking at line `144` of the code shows you what conditions you need for the flag to be put on your screen.

When tracing back, the first conditional we see is:
```c
if((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0)
```
In order to pass this conditional, we need to be requesting a read for item `0`

In order to get to that conditional, we should have inputted data before reading, as you can see at line `180`
```c
if (inputs == 0) {
    puts("No data yet");
    continue;
}
```

The data we put in is totally random
